Per initial brief 

Fix existing landing page 

1. Fix animation picture to be static 
2. Change hover over employees to be same colour purple, as the “our team” 
3. Our produces arrows, need to be properly aligned with text centred 
4. Let’s Work Together Page - need Favicon, to be centred with very low opacity so writing goes over it. 
5. Remove Instagram boxes from contact form and move to bottom of footer. No boxes, just change hover colour 
6. Make the bottom of the page have no white gap. So it finishes at the picture footer 
7. Change colours of shapes in “let’s work together” section. 

8. Change the footer to match the figma footer “footer and let’s talk”
